# Issue #794 — PSI integration broken for C/C++ in CLion: Bug Inventory

**Reporter**: @vs49688  
**Environment**: CLion 2026.1.1 (Nova C++ engine), CMake project (vsclib), Linux/NixOS  
**Issue opened**: 2026-06-02  
**Last updated**: 2026-06-23 (IDE bench expanded to the refactoring-navigation tools
`find_implementations`, `get_type_hierarchy`, `get_call_hierarchy`: **bench-confirmed broken on CLion Nova** — see
#4/#5/#6 — so they are benched on IU only; the earlier headless-only "fixed"
verdicts were corrected)

---

## Debug / Development Workflow

Since CLion Nova PSI is only available in a real CLion instance (not reproducible in IntelliJ headless tests), the
workflow for this issue is:

1. **Make a code change** in IntelliJ IDEA.
2. **Run the "Deploy to CLion" run configuration** — this builds the plugin ZIP and installs it into the local CLion
   sandbox, then restarts CLion.
3. **Poll the MCP health endpoint** until it responds and reports the new version. The version string in the response
   matches the short git commit hash of the installed build, so you can confirm the right build is running:
   ```
   GET http://localhost:<port>/mcp/health
   # Wait for {"status":"ok","version":"<commit-hash>"}
   ```
4. **Connect to the MCP directly** and test the changed tool against real CLion Nova C++ PSI (e.g., open `main.cpp` or
   `classdef.h` and call `get_file_outline`).

## PSI / Code Navigation Tools

### 1. `get_file_outline` — empty results for C/C++

**Original bug (v1.171.4)**: Returns "No structural elements found" / empty results for all `.c`, `.cpp`, `.hpp`
files.  
**Root cause identified**: Custom keyword-matching against PSI class names; CLion Nova uses different class name
prefixes than the old OC engine.  
**Fix attempted**: PR #796 — replaced custom classification with `StructureViewBuilder`.  
**Fix attempted (Jun 6)**: PR #814 — two new fixes targeting CLion Nova specifically:

1. `NavigationTool.visitStructureNode` now extracts the PSI element from custom adapter wrappers (CLion Nova returns
   wrapper objects, not `PsiElement`, from `StructureViewTreeElement.getValue()`
   — the old code silently dropped every node).
2. `ToolUtils.classifyElement` dropped the per-language prefix switchboard (the old `OC` branch never fired for CLion
   Nova which uses `Cidr`/`Nova` prefixes). Now a single language-agnostic classifier matches structural keywords
   anywhere in the PSI class name.

**Fix confirmed broken (Jun 11)**: PR #814 StructureView path confirmed empty even with the Structure panel open —
`ProtocolStructureViewBuilder` programmatic instances never populate in CLion Nova regardless of IDE state.

**Fix applied (Jun 11)**: PR #837 — dropped the StructureView path for CLion Nova; added a direct PSI node-type walk
(`collectOutlineEntriesByNodeType`) as the final fallback. Detects:

- **Type declarations** (class, struct, enum, union): `ASTWrapperPsiElement` containing a
  `DUMMY_NODE` name child and a `DUMMY_BLOCK` body child.
- **Function definitions**: top-level `DUMMY_NODE` signature immediately followed by a
  `DUMMY_BLOCK` sibling (look-ahead at the file level).

Confirmed working against a real CLion Nova instance (`main.cpp`, `classdef.h` — classes, structs, and functions all
returned correctly).

**Scope note**: `collectOutlineEntriesByNodeType` is called exclusively by `GetFileOutlineTool`.
`search_symbols` wildcard uses a separate `collectSymbolsFromFile` path (also a `PsiNamedElement`
walk) that has the same CLion Nova blind spot and is **not** fixed by this PR — see bug #1b below.

**Current status**: ✅ **Fixed in PR #837** for `get_file_outline`. Confirmed working in CLion Nova via direct MCP test.
Pending reporter re-verification in their vsclib project.

**Namespace gap found & fixed (Jun 14)**: The integration bench (`GetFileOutlineClionIntegrationTest`)
kept failing on the `fixtures/cpp-cmake/classdef.h` fixture, whose `Widget`/`Point`/`Colour` symbols live inside
`namespace vsc { ... }`. Root cause (reproduced locally against a real CLion Nova, **not**
a timing/editor issue): the node-type walk only iterated the file's direct children, so it descended into the
`namespace` node's body and emitted nothing. An earlier "open an editor before polling" fix (commit `74c41b43d`) was a
false lead — proven inert because the StructureView path is dead in Nova regardless of editor state, and a warm Nova
returns top-level symbols for unopened files. That commit was reverted.

Inside a namespace body CLion Nova represents each declaration as a **flat `DUMMY_NODE` token stream**
(`DUMMY_NODE[CppKeyword:CLASS_KEYWORD][IDENTIFIER]` + sibling `DUMMY_BLOCK`), not the structured
`CppKeyword:CLASS_KEYWORD` node used at file top level — a different extraction path. The namespace node itself is
`CppKeyword:NAMESPACE_CPP_KEYWORD` wrapping a `DUMMY_NODE` (name) + `DUMMY_BLOCK` (body).

Fix: `walkCppSymbolsIn` now recurses into namespace bodies and handles the nested `DUMMY_NODE`
declaration form (type definitions, free functions, and nested namespaces; forward declarations with no following
`DUMMY_BLOCK` are skipped). Verified live on doxygen's `regex.h`/`config.h` and the exact fixture file —
`namespace vsc / class Widget / struct Point / enum Colour` all returned.

### 1b. `search_symbols` — empty results for C/C++ wildcard queries

**Original bug (v1.171.4)**: Returns empty for wildcard queries against `.c`/`.cpp`/`.hpp` files.  
**Root cause**: `collectSymbolsFromFile` (used by wildcard `search_symbols`) walks the PSI tree looking for
`PsiNamedElement` instances. CLion Nova's lazy C++ parser does not produce
`PsiNamedElement` for declarations — the same root cause as the original `get_file_outline` bug, but in a separate code
path that was not covered by PR #837.  
**Fix attempted (Jun 6)**: PR #814 — language-agnostic classifier (same fix as `get_file_outline`), but this does not
help because the `PsiNamedElement` instanceof check runs before `classifyElement`
is ever called.  
**Fix applied (Jun 11)**: PR #838 — `NavigationTool.collectSymbolsFromFile` now falls back to the same CLion Nova
node-type walk used by `get_file_outline`. The shared helper
`walkCppSymbolsByNodeType` (extracted from `collectOutlineEntriesByNodeType`) detects type declarations
(class/struct/enum/union via `CppKeyword:*_KEYWORD`) and function definitions (`DUMMY_NODE` followed by `DUMMY_BLOCK`
sibling) when the `PsiNamedElement` walk yields no results for a given file. Supports `type=class`, `type=struct`,
`type=function` (and `type=method` as an alias for function). Compat test `SearchSymbolsCompatTest` updated from
expected-FAIL to expected-PASS.  
**Current status**: ✅ **Fixed in PR #838**. Awaiting CLion Nova verification.

---

### 2. `get_symbol_info` — "No named symbol found at file:line"

**Original bug (v1.171.4)**: Fails for any position in C/C++ files.  
**Fix attempted**: PR #796 — same fix as above.  
**Fix attempted (Jun 6)**: PR #814 — same fixes as bug #1; `get_symbol_info` shares the same PSI-classification path so
the language-agnostic classifier should benefit both.  
**Root cause confirmed (Jun 17)**: PR #814's classifier fix never helped here — `get_symbol_info`
doesn't call `ToolUtils.classifyElement` at all. Its own `findNamedAncestor` walks PSI ancestors looking for a
`PsiNamedElement`, the exact same root cause as the original `get_file_outline` /
`search_symbols` bugs (#1 / #1b): CLion Nova's lazy C++ parser produces no `PsiNamedElement` for declarations.
Reproduced live against a real CLion Nova instance (doxygen's `src/anchor.h:25`,
`class AnchorGenerator`) — confirmed broken before the fix below.  
**Fix applied (Jun 17)**: Added `NavigationTool.findEnclosingCppDeclaration` — walks up from the element at the
requested offset looking for the same CLion Nova node shapes `get_file_outline` /
`search_symbols` already recognize (a type declaration's single CppKeyword-wrapped node; a function's `DUMMY_NODE`
+sibling-`DUMMY_BLOCK` pair; and, mirroring `visitNestedDeclaration`, the flat `DUMMY_NODE` token-stream form used for
declarations nested inside a namespace body).
`GetSymbolInfoTool` falls back to it when the ordinary `PsiNamedElement` walk finds nothing. Verified live against a
real CLion Nova instance: `class`/`struct`/`enum`/`namespace` at both file top level (doxygen `src/anchor.h`) and
namespace-nested (this repo's `fixtures/cpp-cmake/classdef.h`
— `vsc::Widget`, `vsc::Point`, `vsc::Colour`, and the `vsc` namespace itself) and a free function (doxygen
`src/util.cpp:161`) all now resolve correctly. IntelliJ Java unaffected (still resolves via the original
`PsiNamedElement` walk).  
**Current status**: ✅ **Fixed and verified live in CLion Nova.** Added to the IDE compatibility bench as
`GetSymbolInfoIntegrationTest` (`get_symbol_info` × {IU, CL}).

---

### 3. `go_to_declaration` — "Could not resolve declaration"

**Original bug (v1.171.4)**: Fails for C/C++ symbols.  
**Root cause** (Jun 6): The old `findDeclarationsOnLine`/`findDeclarationByOffset` walked the PSI tree and called
`element.getReference()` on each match. For C/C++ leaf identifiers (e.g.
`printf`), `getReference()` returns `null` — the reference lives on a parent expression. The fallback only searched the
first occurrence, never adjusted the offset for whitespace, and didn't handle `PsiPolyVariantReference`.  
**Fix attempted (Jun 6)**: PR #815 — replaced with a single `resolveDeclarationsOnLine` that delegates to the IDE's
language-agnostic infrastructure:

1. `PsiFile.findReferenceAt(offset)` (uses every language plugin's registered reference contributors; handles
   polyvariant via `multiResolve`).
2. Parent-walk fallback (some plugins still attach references higher up the tree).
3. `TargetElementUtil.getNamedElement` for the "go-to-declaration-on-a-declaration" case. Uses
   `TargetElementUtil.adjustOffset` so whitespace/punctuation no longer breaks lookup.

**Current status**: ❌ **Broken on CLion Nova (bench-confirmed, 2026-08-01) — the ✅ above was a false positive.**
`GoToDeclarationIntegrationTest` was green from the day it landed, but only because `findAndFormatDeclaration`'s failure
message lacked the `"Error: "` prefix (the bug fixed project-wide by #931): the test's
`assertFalse(result.startsWith("Error"))` passed on the unprefixed text, and `assertTrue(result.contains("Widget"))`
passed too because the *failure message itself* echoes the symbol name ("Could not resolve declaration for
'Widget' ..."). Once #931 added the `err(...)` prefix to this exact return (`GoToDeclarationTool.java`), the same real,
unchanged behaviour — CLion Nova never resolves `main.cpp:12`'s `vsc::Widget` usage to its declaration in `classdef.h` —
started failing the bench correctly. Confirmed identical failure text/timing across 3 separate CI runs (2026-07-31,
2026-08-01 ×2) on real Nova under CI, so this is a deterministic bug, not indexing-timing flakiness (the bench already
waits on
`get_indexing_status` before calling any tool).

Root cause not yet isolated — needs live CLion PSI inspection to distinguish two hypotheses:
(a) `TargetElementUtil.adjustOffset` snaps the raw text offset onto the wrong token for a namespace-qualified name under
Nova's C++ lexer, so `PsiFile.findReferenceAt` looks at a reference-less node (e.g. the `::` token) instead of the
`Widget` identifier; or (b) Nova's lazy frontend genuinely returns no reference for the qualified-name leaf, matching
the
`PsiNameIdentifierOwner`-shaped gaps already bench-confirmed for bugs #4/#5/#6. (a) is fixable in
`GoToDeclarationTool`; (b) would need the same "IU only, CL skips" treatment as #4/#5/#6. The
"Deploy to CLion" workflow (see top of this doc) is the way to test both live, but is currently blocked locally by the
2026.2.0.1 `intellijPlatform.localPath` breakage — see issue #968. Tracked in issue #970.

---

### 4. `get_call_hierarchy` — "Could not find symbol at file:line"

**Original bug (v1.171.4)**: Fails for C/C++ symbols.  
**Root cause** (Jun 6): Same shape as bug #3 — `resolveNamedElementAtLocation` only looked for a declaration on the
target line. If the user pointed at a usage (e.g. line containing `printf("hello")`), no declaration named `printf`
exists there, so the tool reported the error.  
**Fix attempted (Jun 6)**: PR #816 — added `resolveViaReference` fallback mirroring the PR #815 approach: scan
whole-identifier occurrences of the symbol on the line, `TargetElementUtil.adjustOffset`,
`PsiFile.findReferenceAt` (handles polyvariant), then `TargetElementUtil.getNamedElement` as final fallback. The
resolved target must be a `PsiNameIdentifierOwner` for `ReferencesSearch` to find its callers.

**Current status**: ❌ **Broken on CLion Nova (bench-confirmed, 2026-06).** PR #816's reference fallback resolves nothing
on real Nova: `ToolUtils.resolveNamedElement` requires a
`PsiNameIdentifierOwner`, which Nova's lazy C++ frontend PSI never produces for a declaration or a usage, so resolution
returns `null` → "Could not find symbol". Even with resolution fixed,
`ReferencesSearch` has no C++ query executor on the Nova frontend (the semantic index lives in the Radler backend), so
callers cannot be found. The earlier "fixed" verdict was headless-only and did not exercise the real backend. The IDE
bench (PR #874) therefore covers this cell on **IU only**; CL skips (❓). A real fix needs a Nova-frontend resolution +
search path and must be iterated against a real CLion.

---

### 5. `find_implementations` — "Symbol not found at file:line"

**Original bug (v1.171.4)**: Fails for C/C++ symbols.  
**Root cause** (Jun 6): Same shape as bugs #3 and #4 — `TypeHierarchySupport.findSubtypes` only looked for a declaration
on the target line via `ToolUtils.findNamedElement`. If the user pointed at a usage (constructor call site, method
invocation), no declaration was found there and the tool returned "Symbol 'X' not found at file:line". In C/C++ this is
especially bad because leaf identifiers usually have no reference of their own.  
**Fix attempted (Jun 6)**: PR #817 — extracted the PR #815/#816 reference-fallback path into a shared
`ToolUtils.resolveNamedElement` (declaration-first → reference-fallback via
`TargetElementUtil.adjustOffset` + `PsiFile.findReferenceAt` + polyvariant-aware
`firstNamedTarget` + `TargetElementUtil.getNamedElement`). `CallHierarchySupport` refactored to delegate to the shared
helper; `TypeHierarchySupport.findSubtypes` adopts it. Language-agnostic.

**Current status**: ❌ **Broken on CLion Nova (bench-confirmed, 2026-06).** The shared
`ToolUtils.resolveNamedElement` requires a `PsiNameIdentifierOwner`, which Nova's lazy C++ frontend never produces (for
declarations or usages), so `find_implementations` returns "Symbol not found"
on real Nova. Even with resolution fixed, `DefinitionsScopedSearch` has no C++ query executor on the Nova frontend, so
subtypes/implementations cannot be searched. The IDE bench (PR #874) covers this cell on **IU only** (where `Widget`
correctly reports "no subtypes"); CL skips (❓).

---

### 6. `get_type_hierarchy` — "Direction 'both' requires a Java project" / "Symbol not found"

**Original bug (v1.171.4)**: Hard-coded Java guard for `both` direction; PSI lookup fails for non-Java.  
**Root cause** (Jun 6): Two issues. (1) Symbol resolution — already addressed via the shared
`ToolUtils.resolveNamedElement` adopted by `TypeHierarchySupport.findSubtypes` in PR #817. (2)
`GetTypeHierarchyTool` hard-failed for any non-Java direction (default `both` is the most common usage), even though the
language-agnostic subtypes path worked fine.  
**Fix attempted (Jun 6)**: PR #818 — partial-results fallback for `direction=both`, with a
"press Ctrl+H" hint for supertypes.  
**Fix improved (Jun 7)**: PR #819 — removes the Ctrl+H hint (useless to an autonomous agent) and adds real programmatic
supertypes via the shared `ToolUtils.findSuperElementsViaPlatform` helper (reflective
`FindSuperElementsHelper.findSuperElements` + reflective `getSupers()`). Recursive walk up to 10 levels with cycle
detection. `direction=both` now returns subtypes AND supertypes programmatically; `direction=supertypes` returns
programmatic results. Clear "not available"
error only when no helper is loadable at all (pure non-Java IDE without Java plugin).

**Current status**: ❌ **Broken on CLion Nova (bench-confirmed, 2026-06).** The `direction=both`
guard fix (PR #818/#819) is real, but the underlying *symbol resolution* still fails on Nova: the shared
`ToolUtils.resolveNamedElement` requires a `PsiNameIdentifierOwner` that Nova's lazy C++ frontend never produces, so
`get_type_hierarchy` returns "Symbol not found" on real Nova before any direction logic runs. `DefinitionsScopedSearch`
(subtypes) also has no C++ query executor on the frontend. Programmatic supertypes/subtypes work on **Java (IU)** — the
IDE bench (PR #874) covers the subtypes cell on IU only; CL renders 🚫. The previous "✅ Fixed" verdict reflected headless
Java tests, not real Nova.

> **Live-CLion verification (2026-06-22, doxygen project, Nova C++).** Probed the running plugin's
> MCP server directly against real C++ code to settle this empirically:
> - `get_symbol_info` at `src/classdef.h:103` **resolves** `class ClassDef` (via the Nova node-walk
>   in `NavigationTool.findEnclosingCppDeclaration`) — so a Nova resolution primitive *does* exist.
> - `find_implementations` / `get_type_hierarchy` at the **same** position both return
>   `Error: Symbol 'ClassDef' not found` — they use `ToolUtils.resolveNamedElement` (needs a
>   `PsiNameIdentifierOwner`), not the Nova primitive, so resolution fails.
> - `find_references(ClassDef)` returns 102 hits, but they are the **word-search fallback**
>   (`PsiSearchHelper.processElementsWithWord`) — the result list includes header-comment line 1 and
>   bare `{`/`}` lines, not semantic references. This proves Nova's frontend has **no working
    > semantic search**: `ReferencesSearch` / `DefinitionsScopedSearch` have no C++ query executor.
>
> **Conclusion.** Fixing resolution alone (adding the Nova primitive as a fallback) is **not enough**
> and would be *dishonest*: `ClassDef` genuinely has subtypes (`ClassDefImpl`, `ClassDefMutable`),
> but `DefinitionsScopedSearch` would return empty → a false "no implementations". An honest fix
> requires routing hierarchy/reference queries to the C++ semantic backend (clangd/Radler), which is
> a real feature, not a frontend fallback. Until then these three tools are correctly 🚫 on CLion.

### 7. `find_super_methods` — "requires Java PSI support"

**Original bug (v1.171.4)**: Hard-coded Java guard, rejects non-Java files entirely.  
**Root cause** (Jun 7): The tool short-circuited any non-Java IDE with a generic "requires Java PSI support" error
before even attempting to resolve the position.  
**Fix attempted (Jun 7)**: PR #819 — drops the hard `hasJava` rejection. For non-Java IDEs, resolves the enclosing named
declaration via `PsiNameIdentifierOwner` walk and uses the shared
`ToolUtils.findSuperElementsViaPlatform` helper (reflective `FindSuperElementsHelper` + reflective
`getSupers()`). Returns programmatic results when the helper is loadable. Returns clear "not available" error only in
pure non-Java IDEs without the Java plugin. **No manual-action hints**
(autonomous agents can't press Ctrl+U). Same PR also fixes the equivalent Ctrl+H hint left over from PR #818 in
`get_type_hierarchy`.

**Current status**: ⚠️ **Java-verified only; unverified on CLion Nova.** PR #819 returns programmatic results on
**Java (IU)**, but the same Nova resolution gap as #4/#5/#6 applies — the enclosing-declaration walk relies on
`PsiNameIdentifierOwner`, which Nova's lazy C++ frontend never produces, and `FindSuperElementsHelper` needs a resolved
element. Not yet covered by the IDE bench (no honest green is possible until Nova resolution works). The "✅ Fixed"
verdict reflected headless Java tests, not real Nova.

---

### 8. `get_documentation` — "Symbol not found"

**Original bug (v1.171.4)**: Fails for C/C++ FQNs (e.g., `vsc::Colour32`).  
**Root cause** (Jun 7): Only used `JavaPsiFacade.findClass()` which is Java/Kotlin-only. No fallback for other
languages.  
**Fix applied (Jun 7)**: PR #820 — added optional `file` and `line` parameters. When provided, uses language-agnostic
position-based resolution (same approach as `go_to_declaration`, `find_implementations`,
`find_super_methods`). Resolves the symbol by cursor position via `ToolUtils.resolveNamedElement`, which delegates to
the IDE's language-aware PSI infrastructure. When only FQN is provided (no file/line), falls back to JavaPsiFacade for
Java/Kotlin. For non-Java languages without file/line, returns a clear error message guiding users to supply file+line
parameters.  
**Secondary fixes** (PR #820):

- `FqnResolver.looksLikeFqn()` now excludes C++ source file extensions (`.cpp`, `.hpp`, `.h`, `.cc`, `.cxx`) to prevent
  filenames from being mistaken for FQNs
- `GetDocumentationTool` validates that `file` and `line` must be provided together (no silent fallback if only one is
  given)
- `ToolUtils.findFileInProjectContent()` added as a fallback that iterates the project's VFS index (handles `temp:///`
  in-memory test files and files not yet synced to LocalFileSystem)
  **Current status**: ✅ **Fixed.** The file+line path (PR #820, `ToolUtils.resolveNamedElement`)
  works for languages that expose a `PsiNameIdentifierOwner` for declarations, but the IDE bench
  (`GetDocumentationIntegrationTest` × CL) proved it still failed on **CLion Nova C++**: its lazy parser produces no
  `PsiNameIdentifierOwner`, so `resolveNamedElement` returned null and the tool reported "No symbol 'Widget' found".
  Fixed by giving `GetDocumentationTool`'s position path the same node-type-based fallback `get_symbol_info` already
  uses — when `resolveNamedElement` finds nothing, fall back to `CppNovaPsiSupport.findEnclosingDeclaration` (issue
  #794's shared C++ blind spot). Now covered for {IU, CL} by the bench against the real CLion Nova backend.

---

### 9. `get_available_actions` (with symbol) — "No actions available"

**Original bug (v1.171.4)**: Returns empty for any C/C++ position.  
**Root cause investigation (Jun 7)**: Two issues identified:

1. `collectIntentionNames` catches `Exception` generically, which silently swallows
   `ProcessCanceledException` — a platform control-flow exception that CLion Nova C++ intentions may throw when their
   analysis engine is not yet ready. By catching and discarding it, all CLion-specific intentions are silently dropped
   from the result.
2. Both `collectQuickFixesOnly` and `collectActionsWithIntentions` used `resolveVirtualFile` without the
   `findFileInProjectContent` fallback (same gap fixed in other tools).

**Fix applied (Jun 7)**: PR #821:

- `QualityTool.collectIntentionNames` and `findIntentionByName` now rethrow `ProcessCanceledException`
  so CLion Nova cancellation propagates correctly. Javadoc updated to document the exception contract.
- `QualityTool.resolveVirtualFileWithFallback()` shared helper added — all four quality tools that do file resolution
  (`GetAvailableActionsTool` both paths, `ApplyActionTool`, `GetActionOptionsTool`)
  now use it so the full list→apply→inspect-options workflow uses a consistent resolver.
- Blank `symbol` (non-null but whitespace) now treated as absent in the "No actions available"
  and header formatters — consistent with `resolveColumn()`.
- "No actions available" response includes diagnostic counts: registered intentions checked and daemon highlight count
  on the line.
- Tests: 3 new cases (blank symbol, temp:/// quick-fix path, temp:/// symbol path).

**Known limitation**: `IntentionManager.getAvailableIntentions()` may not include all CLion Nova C++ intentions if
they're registered via a different extension mechanism in CLion's own plugin system. If the diagnostic output shows "0
registered intentions", a deeper investigation into CLion's intention registration is needed.

**Current status**: ❓ **Needs reporter re-verification once PR #821 ships.** `ProcessCanceledException`
fix is definitely correct; whether it's the full root cause requires CLion testing.

---

### 10. `find_references` — noise / false positives

**Original bug (v1.171.4)**: Returns false-positive matches on line 1 of unrelated files, doc/html files, `.agent-work/`
markdown entries. Also braces `{`, `/*`, `#include` lines, `namespace`, `extern "C"` appear as references.  
**Fix attempted**: Various improvements in PR #796 area and PR #801. Qualified names now work (PR #801 / commit
`c73ac5ce`).  
**Current status**: ⚠️ Core references work for both simple and qualified names. Noise (braces, comments, #include
lines, markdown files) still present — known limitation, not yet addressed.

---

### 11. `find_references` — qualified C++ names return 0 results

**Original bug (v1.179.7)**: `vsc::for_each_delim`, `vsc::Colour32` etc. return 0 results even though unqualified names
work. PSI word index doesn't accept `::` separator.  
**Fix applied**: PR #801 / commit `c73ac5ce` — `simpleNameOf()` extracts rightmost token; qualifier tokens matched
against PSI ancestor chain.  
**Current status**: ✅ **Confirmed fixed by reporter in v1.179.16** (Jun 6).

---

### 12. `get_highlights` / `get_problems` — blank messages and severity collapsed to INFORMATION

**Original bug (v1.171.4)**: >95% of entries have blank/null message text; all severities reported as `INFORMATION`
regardless of actual severity (no ERROR/WARNING differentiation). Clang-Tidy inspections *are* detected but unusable.  
**Root cause** (Jun 8): Two separate issues identified. (1) Blank descriptions: CLion Nova's Clang-Tidy inspections may
return `HighlightInfo` entries with null or blank description strings. The old code only filtered `null`, not blank
strings, so these entries appeared in the output as useless entries. (2) Severity reporting: Not yet investigated — all
severities still show as INFORMATION regardless of actual severity level.  
**Fix applied (Jun 8)**: PR #822 (this branch):

- `GetHighlightsTool.java` and `GetProblemsTool.java` — added `isBlank()` check alongside the null check so
  highlights/problems with blank descriptions are now filtered out (same filter as the null check).
- `ensureDaemonAnalyzed` — removed `DaemonCodeAnalyzer.restart()` call which was clearing cached highlights and forcing
  a full re-analysis. This was breaking CLion C++ files whose Clang-Tidy pass takes longer than the wait timeout.
  Opening the file is sufficient to trigger daemon analysis automatically if not yet analyzed.
- `ensureDaemonAnalyzed` — extended daemon wait timeout from 5s to 15s to accommodate slower C++ analysis.
- Test: `testGetHighlightsFiltersBlankDescriptions` verifies the tool doesn't crash or include blank entries.

**Known limitation**: Severity reporting (all severities show as INFORMATION) is NOT fixed — still needs
investigation.  
**Current status**: ❓ **Needs reporter re-verification once PR #822 ships.** Blank descriptions are filtered; severity
reporting remains broken.

---

### 13. `get_highlights` — regression: previously-working warning disappeared

**Regression introduced sometime between v1.179.7 and v1.179.16**.  
In v1.179.7, `get_highlights` on `colour.cpp` returned at least one warning: "Possibly unused #include directive".  
In v1.179.16, `get_highlights` on `colour.cpp` and `memory.c` returns empty.  
**Root cause** (Jun 8): The `DaemonCodeAnalyzer.restart()` call in `ensureDaemonAnalyzed` was clearing any cached
highlights and forcing a full re-analysis. For CLion C++ files whose Clang-Tidy pass takes longer than the 5s timeout,
this meant highlights were being cleared and never re-accumulated before the tool returned, resulting in empty output.  
**Fix applied (Jun 8)**: PR #822 (this branch) — same fix as bug #12. Removed the `restart()` call and extended the
timeout from 5s to 15s. Opening the file is sufficient to trigger daemon analysis automatically if not yet analyzed; the
restart was counterproductive.  
**Current status**: ❓ **Needs reporter re-verification once PR #822 ships.** Fix is a regression fix, not tested in an
actual CLion Nova C++ project.

## Run / Test Tools

### 14. `run_configuration` — timeout and "Cannot run on `<default>`"

**Bug (v1.179.7)**: Builds (triggers cmake) but times out at 60s. IDE shows "Error running 'vsclib_tests': Cannot run '
vsclib_tests' on '<default>'". No output captured via `read_run_output`.  
**Fix attempted**: None.  
**Current status**: ❌ **Still broken as of v1.179.16** (Jun 6). Never investigated.

### 15. `run_tests` — hardcodes Gradle, fails for CLion test frameworks

**Bug (v1.171.4)**: Returns "Gradle run configuration type not available". Fails for Catch2, Google Test, Doctest.  
**Root cause (Jun 22)**: `RunTestsTool.execute` tries, in order, `tryRunTestConfig` (existing JUnit/test-named run
configs), `tryRunViaConfigurationContext` (PSI-element → `ConfigurationContext`), and `tryRunJUnitNatively`, then falls
through to a **Gradle-only** `runTestsViaGradleConfig`. The
`ConfigurationContext` path is the only language-agnostic one, but it depends on
`resolveTestPsiElement`, which requires the target to resolve to a `PsiNamedElement` classified as a class — exactly the
CLion Nova C++ blind spot from bugs #1/#1b/#2. So for a C++ target every path fails and the Gradle fallback emits the
misleading "Gradle run configuration type not available"
error. The fix must make the fallback framework-agnostic (CTest/Catch2/GoogleTest run-config production from a
file/location context) rather than Gradle-only.  
**Fix attempted**: None yet — fix branch pending; a `RunTestsIntegrationTest` cell (Testing group)
will confirm the ❌ empirically and guard the fix.  
**Current status**: ❌ **Still broken** (confirmed in bot's Jun 5 update). Root cause identified Jun 22; never fixed for
CLion.

### 16. `list_tests` — crashed with "Missing extension point: com.intellij.testFramework"

**Bug (v1.171.4)**: `TestFramework.EXTENSION_NAME.getExtensionList()` throws `IllegalArgumentException` in CLion because
the extension point is declared in the Java plugin, not loaded in CLion.  
**Fix applied**: PR #806 / commit `ddda3937` — `safeGetTestFrameworks()` wraps in try-catch; fallback detection via
file-name heuristics and `TestBody()` pattern for Google Test macro expansion.  
**Current status**: ✅ No longer crashes. ⚠️ Partial — test method discovery may still be incomplete depending on CMake
test source root configuration. Not re-verified by reporter in latest comment.

## Debug Tools

### 17. `debug_session_start` — session starts then immediately terminates

**Bug (v1.179.7)**: Session appears in `debug_session_list` momentarily then dies. All subsequent debug tools report "No
active debug session".  
**Fix attempted**: None.  
**Current status**: ❌ **Still broken as of v1.179.16** (Jun 6). Never investigated. Workaround: user starts session
manually from IDE.

---

### 18. `breakpoint_manage` (add) — false negative

**Bug (v1.171.4 / v1.179.7)**: Returns "Failed to add breakpoint — the file or line may not support breakpoints", but
the breakpoint IS actually added (confirmed by `breakpoint_list`). Affects both `.c` and `.cpp` files.  
**Root cause**: After `toggleLineBreakpoint()` in CLion/C++, `getSourcePosition()` is null because debug symbol index
hasn't resolved yet. The old code required a non-null source position to match the breakpoint.  
**Fix applied**: Commit `48806b53` (merged via PR #807, released in v1.179.14).  
**Current status**: ❓ The fix IS in v1.179.16 that the reporter tested. The reporter's Jun 6 comment did not explicitly
re-verify `breakpoint_manage` add. Needs targeted re-verification — either the fix is ineffective in CLion Nova or the
bug is fixed and the reporter simply didn't retest.

---

### 19. `debug_evaluate` — phantom MODAL_BLOCKING then consistent TimeoutException

**Bug (v1.179.7)**: First attempt triggers MODAL_BLOCKING with no visible dialog; subsequent attempts all timeout for
any expression including trivial `1+1`.  
**Fix attempted**: None.  
**Current status**: ❌ **Still broken as of v1.179.16** (Jun 6). Never investigated.

---

### 20. `debug_variable_detail` — "Variable not found in current frame"

**Bug (v1.179.16)**: Fails for all variable paths tried, even when `debug_snapshot` shows variables are in scope.  
**Fix attempted**: None.  
**Current status**: ❌ **Broken** (first confirmed in latest v1.179.16 report). Never investigated. Note:
`debug_snapshot` and `debug_inspect_frame` now work for a manually-started session but variables don't show values.

---

### 21. `debug_read_console` — shows only binary path, no test output

**Bug (v1.179.7)**: Returns the binary path line but no actual test output from the run.  
**Fix attempted**: None.  
**Current status**: ⚠️ **Still broken as of v1.179.16** (Jun 6). Never investigated.

---

### 22. `debug_step` (into) — doesn't actually step into function calls

**Bug (v1.179.16)**: `debug_step` with action=`into` was marked as broken ("No active debug session") in v1.179.7. In
v1.179.16 with a manually-started session it now executes, but doesn't actually enter the called method — e.g.,
`_p.reset(p)` was stepped over.  
**Fix attempted**: None for the into-specific behavior.  
**Current status**: ⚠️ Partially working — stepping mechanics work but step-into acts like step-over for C++ method
calls. Not yet investigated.

---

### 23. Debug snapshot/step/run-to-line — "No active debug session" for manually-started sessions

**Bug (v1.179.7)**: `debug_snapshot`, `debug_step`, `debug_run_to_line`, `debug_inspect_frame` all returned "No active
debug session" even when a session was visible.  
**Fix applied**: Fixed between v1.179.7 and v1.179.16 (exact commit/PR unknown — not in this branch's log).  
**Current status**: ✅ **Confirmed fixed by reporter in v1.179.16** for manually-started sessions. Blocked by bug #17 for
agent-started sessions.

---

## Build / Coverage Tools

### 24. `read_build_output` — "Build tool window is not available (no Java/Kotlin project)"

**Bug (v1.171.4)**: The JPS Build tool window (ID "Build") is only registered for Java/Kotlin/Gradle/Maven projects.
CLion CMake builds go to the Run tool window, not the Build tool window.  
**Fix applied**: Commit `48806b53` (merged via PR #807, released in v1.179.14) — when Build tool window is absent,
checks Run tool window and lists available tabs.  
**Current status**: ❓ The fix IS in v1.179.16 that the reporter tested. The reporter's Jun 6 comment did not explicitly
re-verify `read_build_output`. Needs targeted re-verification.

---

### 25. `reload_project_model` — crashes with MesonManager `IllegalAccessException`; CMake not attempted

**Bug (v1.179.7)**: `IllegalAccessError` thrown by `com.jetbrains.cidr.meson.MesonManager` (Java 25 module access).
CMake is not listed among attempted build systems and is not reloaded.  
**Fix applied**: PR #804 / commit `86591e51` — catches `Throwable` (not just `Exception`), skips Meson gracefully; adds
`tryCMakeReload()` via `CMakeWorkspace.scheduleReload()`.  
**Current status**: ✅ Fixed (confirmed by bot's Jun 5 update). Not re-verified by reporter in latest comment but no
regression reported.

---

### 26. `get_coverage` — "No coverage data found"

**Bug (v1.171.4)**: No coverage data available in CLion.  
**Fix attempted**: None.  
**Current status**: 📋 Never investigated. Likely requires CMake/gcov/lcov integration, not a simple fix.

---

## Plugin Startup Regression

### 27. Plugin fails to start — `NoClassDefFoundError: org/jacoco/agent/rt/internal_xxx/Offline`

**Regression introduced**: Release v1.179.14. Seven stack traces at startup, plugin completely non-functional.  
**Root cause**: Offline JaCoCo instrumentation baked probe calls into plugin classes, but `PathClassLoader` in CLion
couldn't find `Offline` class from bootstrap delegation.  
**Fix applied**: Commit `2f2578fd` — reverted offline JaCoCo instrumentation entirely.  
**Current status**: ✅ **Confirmed fixed by reporter** — updating to v1.179.16 resolved the startup crash.

---

## Phantom Modal Blockers

### 28. Intermittent `MODAL_BLOCKING` errors with no visible dialog

**Bug (v1.179.7)**: `debug_session_start` and `run_configuration` intermittently fail with `MODAL_BLOCKING` claiming a
popup dialog is open. `interact_with_modal` reports "No modal dialog is currently visible". Likely a notification toast
being misidentified.  
**Fix attempted**: None.  
**Current status**: 📋 **Still present** (confirmed in v1.179.16 — `debug_evaluate` triggered one). Never investigated.
